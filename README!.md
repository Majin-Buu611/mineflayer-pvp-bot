# Mineflayer-pvp-bot
This bot is created using the Java Script API Mineflayer.
You can use this bot to practice your pvp skills.

## Instructions
You need to have node.js installed, and you should probably upgrade it to the latest version.
Download this repository, then unzip the zip file, then there should be another zip file.
Unzip the second one, and put the folder where ever you want to store it.
Open up the Command Prompt if you are on Windows, or whatever tourmanal that you have that functions like the Command Prompt.
navigate to wherever you chose to store the bot using the cd command if you are onWindows or MAC, if you are on another operating system, i don't know what command you would need to use.
then type "cd pvp-bot" if you didbn't rename the folder, if you did, then replace the pvp-bot part with whatever you renamed the folder.
The instruction on the previous line will work for sure on Windows or MAC, if you are on Lynix or another operating system, i don't exactly know what you have to do to achieve this.
After you have done that, whether you are on lynix or MAC, or Windows, you should see a file called "index.js".
then run node.js <host> <port> <username> <password>
  You can find out more at https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md 
You just need to go down to a section called "Command line arguments", and start reading from there.
  You shouldn't have to read far to get the information you need.
After the bot joins your server or lan world, you can throw armor on it, and a sword.
  You can also throw a shield on it if you want to.
  Type "fight me" in the chat and prepare for your doom.
You can type "stop" and it will stop attacking you.
I hope you will enjoy this bot.
